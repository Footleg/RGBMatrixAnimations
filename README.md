# RGBMatrixAnimations
Animation library for RGB LED matrix displays. These are hardware independent classes which can be displayed on any suitable grid of RGB pixels or LEDs. You can checkout this repository into your Arduino libraries folder, and include the animation classes in your sketches. There are also examples you can compile to run on a Raspberry Pi using the Adafruit RGBMatrix HAT with an RGB LED Matrix. See the examples folder for detail on how to build these.
